# 3.0.1 / 2019-08-11

- Fix typo: initialized to initalize (thanks to @melvincarvalho)

# 3.0.0 / 2019-08-08

- Stores will now automatically use different contexts (thanks to @alexandrius, see #12)  
  This change is 100% backwards compatible and in most cases it should be safe to update.
  But considering possible impact it might have on existing apps with many stores - it's a major release.
